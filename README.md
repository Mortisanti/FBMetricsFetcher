# FBMetricsFetcher

Short for "Facebook Metrics Fetcher", this script was utilized to automatically retrieve Facebook Marketplace metrics data, upload it to an FTP server, and archive it in a ZIP file for backups. It also writes information to a log for each step of its process. Finally, if retrieval fails, it has the ability to send an email notifying the user of its failure, referencing the mentioned log file.
